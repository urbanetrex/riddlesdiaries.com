        <p>It is a medieval-themed park located in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The park features a replica castle, themed attractions, and live performances that bring the medieval era to life.</p>

        <h2 id="out-and-go"><a href="#out-and-go">Out and go!</a></h2>
        <p>It was <time datetime="2025-03-28">March 28, 2025</time>, and we are sitting in our school courtyard waiting for the roll call.</p>
        <p>We were excited to embark on our adventure to Kryal Castle!</p>
        <p>In our school uniforms, we saw a big bus in the parking area nearby. Another bus was going to park there too.</p>
        <p>Our class boarded the second bus. I already packed a small notebook and a pencil.</p>
        <p>I already wrote down:</p>
        <div class="notebook">A visit to <u>Kryal Castle</u> üå∏ üè∞ <br>
Depart: 8:10 <br>
Arrive: 9:30 <br>
<hr>Depart: 1:30 <br>
Arrive: 3:00</div>
        <p>As we settled into our seats, the excitement grew as we anticipated the fun that awaited us at the castle!</p>
        <p>As our bus moved from the parking area, I jot down the time the bus' screen said: <i>8:18 am</i> to my notebook, which now looks like:</p>
        <div class="notebook">A visit to <u>Kryal Castle</u> üå∏ üè∞ <br>
Depart: <del>8:10</del> 8:18 <br>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="on-the-way"><a href="#on-the-way">On the way...</a></h2>
        <p>Our buses travelled to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://google.com/maps/place/National+Highway+M8,+Victoria/@-37.4352226,143.443021,11.67z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6ad694b9444c3225:0xe706c3a37be1335e!8m2!3d-37.4394559!4d143.4859675!16s%2Fg%2F11cjg9b2vx?authuser=0&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">M8 highway</a>, and I saw some people are already passing paper images, drawings, and messages inside the bus.</p>
        <p>I saw some signposts with "Ballarat" engraved on it, sometimes also with "M8".</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the bus took a sharp jerk. I guess we were entering <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Forbes+Road/@-37.5610126,143.9662748,14.73z?authuser=0&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Forbes Road</a>, according to Google Maps I viewed the last day.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes, someone started to shout "Kryal Castle! Kryal Castle!" and everyone started to chant together. We were all so excited to finally arrive at our destination!</p>
        <p>After another minute, I saw Kryal Castle. Our bus parked beside the other bus we had just met at the school.</p>
        <p>Before going off the bus, I jot down the time on the screen: <i>9:43am</i>. My notebook looks like:</p>
        <div class="notebook">A visit to <u>Kryal Castle</u> üå∏ üè∞ <br>
Depart: <del>8:10</del> 8:18 <br>
Arrive: <del>9:30</del> 9:43 <br>
<hr>Depart: 1:30 <br>
Arrive: 3:00</div>
        <p>As we disembarked, the excitement was palpable, and we could see the castle's towers rising in the distance!</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="morning"><a href="#morning">Arrival at Kryal Castle</a></h2>
        <p>We crossed a draw bridge before entering the castle, just like a real medieval castle. I even saw a real moat!</p>
        <p>Some were exclaiming "Wow! Look at that!" as we approached the entrance.</p>
        <p>Some assistants left their jobs to tour us (probably they knew we were coming because our school contacted them.)</p>
        <p>We first gathered at an assembly point, under a big shade building. We left our bags there. The assistants explained the day's activities and rules to us.</p>
        <p>Only our grade are coming, and there were four classes. We headed for different activities.</p>
        <p>Our class first headed to the <b>archery shed</b>.</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="archery"><a href="#archery">Archery</a></h2>
        <p>As we entered the shed, I saw a board saying the arrows' prices were displayed... but since our school must've had contacted them, we ignored them... but I still used them for jokes.</p>
        <p>We were all eager to try our hand at archery, and the instructors were very friendly, explaining the safety rules and how to properly use the bows and arrows.</p>
        <p>We had 3 turns each. It actually turned out to be a lot of fun.</p>
        <p>After our turns, we gathered to share our experiences and see who hit the target the best!</p>
        <p>I also noticed that the targets are painted on hay and the border is made of hay blocks too... but I saw something interesting: Five arrows <b>FLEW INTO THE ROOF</b>!!!</p> </section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="leather"><a href="#leather">Leather</a></h2>
        <p>After archery, we headed to some open tables with some tools on them.</p>
        <p>We learned about the different types of leather and how it is processed.</p>
        <p>But leather can be made of <b>urine... and human skin too...</b></p>
        <p>It is a surprising fact that highlights the various materials that can be used in leather production.</p>
        <p>We also got to try our hand at making small leather items, which was a fun and creative activity.</p>
        <p>An assistant got out some leather pieces, bowls of water, and some cloth.</p>
        <p>We learned how to shape the leather and create simple designs.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the assistant gave our leather punched holes for hanging.</p>
        <p>We were excited to use the leather pieces for our crafts!</p></section>

        <section class="info unsure">
        <h2 id="lunch"><a href="#lunch">Lunch</a></h2>
        <p><i>I forgot where I should put this section, here or after the next section?</i></p>
        <p>After our activities, we gathered for lunch, sharing stories about our experiences at Kryal Castle.</p>
        <p>We enjoyed sandwiches, fruit, and drinks while discussing our favorite parts of the day.</p>
        <p>Everyone was excited to share their archery scores and leather creations!</p>
        <p>It was a great time to relax and recharge before the next adventure.</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="medicine"><a href="#medicine">Medicine</a></h2>
        <p>Our next adventure was going to be more interesting!</p>
        <p>We headed to another shed, where we have ceramic mixing bowls and sticks.</p>
        <p>We learned about medieval medicine and how it was practiced during that time.</p>
        <p>We learned about the different herbs and plants used for healing, and how they were divpared.</p>
        <p>We divided to 4 or 6 groups, and each group went to a table with a mixing bowl and a mixing stick. The assistant who explained to us about the medicine got some herbs and <b>showed us how to mix them properly.</b> He handed us some different kinds of herbs and <b>let us try mixing them ourselves!</b></p>
        <p>He also expected them to be sticky, and came around to check.</p>
        <p>We were all fascinated by the different scents and textures of the herbs, and it was a fun and educational experience.</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="hastings"><a href="#hastings">The Battle of Hastings</a></h2>
        <p>We were now reviewing the Battle of Hastings on an open sandy ground.</p>
        <p>The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066 and was a pivotal moment in English history.</p>
        <p>It marked the beginning of Norman rule in England and had lasting effects on the culture and governance of the country.</p>
        <p>We learned about the key figures involved in the battle, including William the Conqueror and King Harold II.</p>
        <p>This assistant also chose some volunteers to demo, and she got a <b>fake CROWN</b> to also show the king!</p>
        <p>Then she got us to take some foam shields and swords to practice, but also warned of the swords' tip is actually not foam, but hard plastic.</p>
        <p>We practiced some basic sword fighting techniques, which was a lot of fun.</p>
        <p>And then the next one will be the last learning activity before recess...</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="dance"><a href="#dance">Dance</a></h2>
        <p>Our classes gathered together on some rocky ground in front of the shade to dance now!</p>
        <p>We planned to learn some medieval dances, but ended up only learning one.</p>
        <p>We grouped into two big circles, including our class teachers and some assistants.</p>
        <p>It was a fun experience, and we all enjoyed trying to follow the steps!</p>
        <p>We then danced with the music, and <b>the music accelerated to more than 3.0x! The laughter got larger as it accelerated</b>!</p></section>

        <section class="info">
        <h2 id="recess"><a href="#recess">Recess</a></h2>
        <p>After the dance, we stayed under the shade. I asked my teacher about the maze <b>ten</b> times.</p>
        <p>We chatted and ate, just like in lunch break.</p>
        <p>It was a nice way to wind down after a fun-filled day!</p>
        <p>I then spent the time writing what I learned to the notebook.</p>

    <p>I realized that 30 minutes had passed after the expected time to depart from Kryal Castle when I finished writing my notes.</p>
    <p>So now when I got up the bus and jot down the depart time, it shows <i>2:07pm</i>.</p>
    <p>It was a memorable day filled with learning and fun!</p>
    <p>Our teachers must have notified our parents that the arrival time will be 30 minutes late.</p>
    <p>As we arrived, I wrote down the time the bus' screen was showing, <i>3:41 pm</i>, before leaving the bus to my parents.</p></section></div>
